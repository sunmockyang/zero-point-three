<p>She was on top of a massive hill. </p>

<p>The ground beneath her was so dry that it shriveled into a million pieces and dissolved into powder beneath her trembling knees and palms. </p>

<p>Opaque clouds roared above her.</p>

<p>She cringed as she stole a glance over her shoulder, past the edge of the peak.</p>

<p>People. Running. All directions. </p>

<p>There was fear dripping from their movements. Their eyes, petrified. She knew they were ruled by something – someone – with horrific power.</p>

<p>A deep pull of discomfort and sorrow welled up in her gut. </p>

<p>She pulled her eyes away from the dreadful spectacle below and looked up. </p>

<p>There in front of her was a man, standing, looking over the chaos. </p>

<p>He had authority. Strength flowed from his still frame. In the pit of her stomach, she knew he was the only one who was able to reverse the horror below. </p>

<p>She crawled closer to him, her hands powdered with dust, and clawed at the hem of his robe. </p>

<p>He smiled down at her.</p>

<p><em>Who is he? What is he doing?</em> She marveled.</p>

<p>Again, he smiled at her, then looked up to the ravenous labyrinth above. </p>

<p>Suddenly, the heavens parted and the skies fell over his head as a flood of light. </p>

<p>“Isa!” she called out to him, as everything roared and dissolved around her.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Isa is the name for Jesus in the Qur’an. </p>

<p>It was this dream that propelled Lili Tleti*, 27, not to Christianity but to Islam 10 years ago. In hindsight, Lili said she had mistaken the Jesus in her dream for the Jesus in Islam – a mere prophet of God and not the Son of God.</p>

<p>She began to consume books about Islam, particularly about religious subgroups in Islam. </p>

<p>Soon, she met some people practicing <em>salafiyya almiyya</em>, translated as “scientific or scripturalist salafism” which differs from the more violent branch of salafism in Tunisia – jihadi salafism. Salafism in Tunisia – a fundamentalist Islamic practice – emerged after the Jasmine Revolution but it had been growing under the radar in the 2000s. During this time, Lili fell deep in to their writings which were forbidden by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Her involvement with the group grew and she began devoting all of her time producing salafi books by hand because there were bad consequences for printing such religious texts under the Ben Ali regime. </p>

<p>When she reached her last year of high school, she decided to stop her studies.</p>

<p>“My only goal was to learn Islam more and to know it deeply,” she said. </p>

<p>Despite the objection from her family, she enrolled in an online university to study Islam. For two years and a half, she attended online conferences and learned under a <em>Sheikh</em>.</p>

<p>During the Ben Ali regime, religious attire was banned in public in an attempt to embrace secularism in Tunisia. The government either jailed salafis on the basis of a tough anti-terrorist legislation or exiled them abroad. Nonetheless, in an act of defiance during this period, Lili removed her <em>hijab</em> and replaced it with the <em>niqab</em>.</p>

<p>Lili’s new attire began to attract investigations by the police. </p>

<p>“They came to the house and investigated everything,” she said. </p>

<p>Because of the “repulsive behavior” of the police, Lili’s brother turned to scientific salafism. Likewise, the harsh treatment and political persecution from the government pushed Lili deeper in to religious conservatism. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, she had been battling depression. When her depression got worse, Lili began questioning her faith and her life. </p>

<p>“Why am I like this? Why am I living like this? Why am I not happy?” she recalled her internal battles. </p>

<p>She began growing a deep hatred for the religion that didn’t heal her.</p>

<p>“I wanted to end my life,” she said. </p>

<p>It was through a documentary about the Big Bang that “changed my whole way of seeing life,” said Lili. She watched the scientific documentary and came out with a unique perspective. “It convinced me that God was above time, and above everything.” </p>

<p>Because of her prior practice of salafi Islam, Christianity was the last thing she could imagine believing in. “Never, never, never,” she said. “For me, I could follow any religion but Christianity.”</p>

<p>But one day in 2012, in a desperate attempt to seek God, she entered a well-known, expatriate church building in Tunis. (Tunisia has a handful of Catholic and Anglican church buildings built by foreigners dating back to before its independence in 1956. Foreigners predominantly use these churches, and many local Tunisians see them as tourist sites or out of bounds.)</p>

<p>When she took her first step inside the sanctuary, tears began flowing, she said. </p>

<p>A man was in the sanctuary and came to her. </p>

<p>“If God created me, why would he send me to hell?” Lili sobbed. </p>

<p>“God is above time,” the man answered, echoing the same revelation she had received earlier. </p>

<p>“Little by little, I started having faith but I was scared,” said Lili. </p>

<p>“I’m a believer now.” </p>

				Secrets and hiding
			</div>
		</div>
<p>This story remains a secret, locked up behind Lili’s dark-chocolate eyes and her beaming, brace-lined smile. </p>

<p>“Yes, I’m hiding,” she laughed, fanning herself in the confines of a bedroom in an apartment just above a noisy, 24-hour, men-only café. Her church friends are renting the humble apartment in Tunis and Lili stays with them during her summer vacation, before heading back to France for her master’s research.</p>

<p>“I never go up to someone and tell them I’m a Christian. I avoid talking about it,” she said. </p>

<p>But 10 days prior to this interview, Lili’s father discovered her identity through an unfortunate event.  </p>


<p>Thieves broke in to her family home and they threw everything out of the drawers and closets in search for valuables. As her father began putting her belongings away, he discovered a little cross, tucked away in a drawer of her dresser. He confronted Lili and she told him the truth. </p>

<p>“He was upset, but then he accepted it,” she said. “But he told me that I have to hide it, especially from my brother and mother, because it could be dangerous for me.” </p>

<p>Her father was the first to discover her identity. Nobody knows she is a Christian in Tunisia except for her close Christian friends from her underground church.</p>

<p>She carried this cross around with her wherever she went, from Paris to Tunis and back. Now, her father is keeping it for good. </p>

<p>Lili lives a double life. </p>

<p>In France where she studies, “I live fully Christian,” she said. “But here in Tunisia, I live hidden and almost in inexistence.” </p>

<p>Lili said her apartment in Paris has Christian books lying around. Her Bible is open on her night table and her cross-necklace can freely drape around her neck. </p>

<p>“I run, I sing, I go freely to church, I pray in the streets, I read the Bible in the park,” said Lili. “Everything related to my faith that I don’t do here, I do it there.” </p>

<p>Many Tunisian Christians like Lili long for this kind of freedom of religious expression in Tunisia. Lili is one of the more fortunate ones who had a taste of this freedom in democratic France. In a transitioning Tunisia, most Tunisian Christians have never tasted such freedoms with regards to their religious identities.</p>

<p>Lili described herself as generally “very reserved” and “a person who hides a lot.” </p>

<p>She is afraid of persecution in Tunisia. She was once persecuted as a fundamentalist Muslim before the revolution; today, she said she risks persecution as a Christian if her identity is exposed. </p>

<p>“I try to be as far as possible from giving clues.” She gets nervous when Christianity is discussed, and avoids directly defending it in case she gets caught. </p>

<p>Lili said she’s been hurt by the words of family members and others, especially when they accuse Christians of being bribed or paid into conversion. This is a common perspective in many Muslim societies in the Arab world.  </p>

<p>“I say to myself, if they lived through even a little bit of what I faced looking for God…” she drifted off. </p>

<p>“I would rather die than deny my faithfulness to Jesus Christ,” she stated. </p>

<p>With regards to unveiling her true identity, she leaned to her God:</p>

<p>“When God decides when it has to be shown, I will be ready.” </p>
