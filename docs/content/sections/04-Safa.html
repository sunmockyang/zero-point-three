It was past noon.</p><p>She had waited for this day for months, ever since they began talking online. Her heart was filled with so much emotion and excitement, but at the same time, peace. She watched as women in headscarves walked by holding hands of children with one hand and baggage with the other. There were men standing by the railings near the arrival sign, lazily cocking their heads as they leaned on the metal rail for support.</p><p>He told her he’d arrive by 11 a.m. that day; they had both forgotten about the hour-difference between Germany and Tunisia. She had been nervously watching the clock for almost two hours and even had a nice conversation with a Tunisian man sitting next to her.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” he had asked her.</p><p>“I’m waiting for my boyfriend,” she answered.</p><p>They continued a casual conversation that led her to telling him about her conversion to Christianity. The man was shocked, but surprisingly polite.</p><p>The sliding doors to the arrival gates opened and her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>From a distance, she spotted him. He stood out from among the Tunisians.</p><p><em>Wow, he’s so tall.</em></p><p>He recognized the long, brown-haired, doe-eyed beauty immediately from all the photos they shared together. They rushed towards each other and like opposite magnets, pulled into an embrace.</p><p>“Finally I can see you and hold you for the first time,” he beamed as he whispered in to her ear.</p><p>“Yeah, you exist!” she laughed into his pounding chest.</p><p>Their hug lasted a full minute, which felt too brief for the couple meeting for the first time after their relationship began online six months prior.</p><p>Now, tucked away in his warm arms, it felt like she knew him for much longer.</p><p>They tore their upper bodies apart just to look in each other’s eyes. The slight nervousness she felt disappeared completely as she looked in to his loving gaze.</p><p>His hair was so light and well kempt, so she reached up with her hand and tousled it. He laughed at her playfulness.</p><p>Side by side, they walked out of the airport in to the sweltering Tunisian heat; it was the beginning of the fiery test of their forbidden love.</p><hr/><div class="section-media"><div class="section-quote-container"><div class="section-quote"> "I can’t marry a person who isn’t Muslim.

This is his grandpa – he’s so funny.”</p><p>Safa and her fiancé Kevin are in a long-distance relationship. She’s in Tunisia and he’s in Germany almost 2,000 kilometres away. They capture every moment of their day and share it with one another.</p><p>“This is his allergy test, and this is his father’s cat – Sam from Russia,” she chortled, holding up a portrait of a cat.</p><p>She spends her whole day with Kevin, by text, by phone, and even by overnight Skype sessions where Safa would fall asleep next to a dark screen and wake up to a sleeping Kevin. Sometimes, they’d sleep talk together, she said giggling.</p><p>“It’s impossible that we spend two hours without communication.”</p><div class="section-media"><div class="section-image" title="Safa laughed as she held up this picture. “It’s his cat.

That day I was laughing so, so much.”</div></div><p>It’s been two years since their relationship sparked online through a Canadian-made mobile app called “Kik” where people around the world interact and chat.</p><p>Safa was seeking to improve her English skills and to talk to others about her newfound faith in Jesus. She had become a Christian in 2011 after several Tunisian friends of hers began to talk to her about Christianity</p><p>“At first my English was so, so, so bad,” she said. “I only knew good morning, good night, hello, what’s your name,” she chuckled.</p><p>She began talking to people in other cultures like India about Christianity.</p><p>It was during these online activities, she found Kevin from Germany. Kevin was a Catholic and so they began talking about religion. They started off chatting just as friends, sharing little details about their lives here and there.</p><p>“And then the story started to change, then it became love, and then he came to my country,” said Safa, grinning from cheek to cheek.</p><p>During Kevin’s first visit to Tunisia in August 2014, they confirmed their love for one another.</p><p>“Then we started loving each other so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so much,” she said.</p><p>He visited again two months later, and then again in March 2015. By this time, they made their engagement decision.</p><p>“He said I choose you to be my woman forever,” said Safa. “And I said I choose you to be my man forever.”</p><div class="section-media"><div class="section-image" title="A shell from Safa and Kevin’s most recent date on the beach. “We don’t throw anything from each other in the garbage, even the wrapper of chocolate.

We still keep it.”</div></div><hr/><p>Safa said she isn’t persecuted for being Christian. Upon her conversion, she revealed that she was Christian to her immediate family and friends.</p><p>“At first, I had fear to tell people about my faith, but after, I said ‘Why am I shy? Jesus came to this earth and suffered for me so why am I ashamed of it?’” she said.</p><p>“My mom, she slapped me two times, but she would never tell me to leave the house,” said Safa. “Because she loves me so much. It really depends on the family.”</p><p>Her mother brought home a <em>Sheikh</em> to convince Safa back to Islam, but to no avail.</p><p>Later, Safa said she was tricked into an interview by a Tunisian journalist who exposed Safa and her Christian friends’ identities online in an article, titled “Danger: On a journey inside the minds of Tunisian youth who converted to Christianity – Parrots fabricating hate to Muhammad and his religion.”</p><p>The journalist pretended to be sympathetic to Safa and her friends, promising not to attach photos. Instead, she said he changed the dialogue they had to fit his narrative, and added their names and home addresses in the article.</p><p>“He said we hate Muhammad (Islam’s prophet) and that we were saying bad things about him,” she said. Safa said no one from her hometown read the article so she had no backlash, but one friend whose photo was published had trouble with salafis (Islamic extremists) in his city Ben Arous.</p><p>Safa’s story is different from those of many of her Christian friends. She is not persecuted at home. Nonetheless, many of her relatives still don’t know of her conversion and she’s keeping it a secret because she doesn’t want her parents to be bothered. “For my (extended) family, I think it’s going to be a big problem.”</p><div class="section-media"><div class="section-image" title="The article that exposed Safa and her friends' Christian identities."> <a href="content/04_Safa/Safa_Website.jpg" class="section-image-wrapper" style="background-image:url('content/04_Safa/thumbs/Safa_Website.jpg')"> </a></div><div class="section-media-caption"> The article that exposed Safa and her friends' Christian identities.</div></div><p>But today, Safa has a problem with the law.</p><p>“I can’t marry a person who isn’t Muslim,” said Safa. “Because for the government, I’m a Muslim because I’m Tunisian.”</p><p>Under the constitution, Tunisia is an Arab, Muslim, democratic country. Whoever is born as a Tunisian is considered an Arab Muslim person.</p><p>Under the law, a Tunisian man is able to marry anyone he wants, whatever their religion and nationality. For women, the story is different.</p><p>A Tunisian woman, by law, cannot marry a foreign, non-Muslim man. If they decide to marry in Tunisia, the man must first convert to Islam by confessing the Shahada, the Muslim confession of faith in the presence of the <em>Mufti</em> – the national religious authority of Tunisia. The <em>Mufti</em> must then present the Certificate of Conversion to City Hall prior to the marriage. The conversion process can take three months or longer. There is also a fee.</p><p>So there is an issue when the foreign man does not want to convert to Islam.</p><p>For Safa and Kevin, Christianity is a fundamental cornerstone in their relationship. It defines who they are as a couple, and conversion to Islam is not a compromise they are willing to make, especially for Safa who has converted out of Islam.</p><p>Safa and Kevin have tried every possible route in Tunisia to find a loophole. They sought guidance from Christian pastors, fellow Christians who have foreigner spouses and various embassies. Four days prior to this interview, Safa had contacted the German embassy in Tunisia. They replied in two days, “They said I have to contact the <em>Mufti</em> and he has to give us the okay. But to give the okay, Kevin has to convert to Islam.”</p><p>“I’d have to marry in another country,” she said. They are preparing papers with the German embassy to get married in Germany.</p><p>But even this is a problem for Safa and Kevin who want to come back to Tunisia to live. Under the law, their marriage in Germany will not be considered legal.</p><p>“The embassy said we can marry in Germany but it’s not guaranteed,” said Safa. “Because if I marry in Germany, in Tunisia I will be single.”</p><p>Safa said she feels like this is a form of persecution by the supposedly democratic Tunisian government. “Because even in the law, it says every Tunisian has the freedom to choose what he believes.”</p><p>“But when you come to the practice of it, you don’t have rights.”</p><hr/><p>“It’s hard and terrible. I hate it so much,” said Safa about having to do a long-distance relationship. “We try to forget about the distance. We try to keep ourselves busy.”</p><p>She smiled sadly, and turned her attention for the 19th or 20th time that hour to her phone.</p><p>She tapped her thumbs on the screen, composing yet another message to the love of her life, still thousands of kilometres away.</p></div></div>
