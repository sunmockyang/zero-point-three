In this region of the world, where the lines of religion and the state have blurred in history, religion has been engrained in the society and in people’s livelihoods. Islamic identity – being a Muslim – has become the norm in many North African countries.</p><p>As a result, Christian converts from this area are viewed as having committed a tremendous act of rebellion against their culture and their deep-rooted identities as Muslims. Tunisian Christians say they believe that they were chosen by God to seek and believe in Christianity. Each convert has his or her own unique story of spiritual revelations and experiences leading to their conversion. But many of them share a common experience – dissatisfaction with the Islam they knew and experienced in their country.</p><div class="section-subtitle" title="Motivations and the psychology behind conversion"><hr/><div class="subtitle-text"> Motivations and the psychology behind conversion</div></div><p>In general, a conversion is linked to material or tangible gains such as being able to marry someone of another faith, said Naomi Goldenberg, a professor of religious psychology at the University of Ottawa. But in Tunisia, Tunisian Christians say they are not receiving any material or social benefits. Instead, they undergo hardships, discrimination, and are regarded as second-class citizens. For this reason, their motives for conversion are much more difficult to pinpoint. What explains this kind of radical decision with such heavy costs and seemingly little gains?</p><p>People convert for all kinds of reasons, said Goldenberg. “There’s no specific psychology behind conversions,” she said, explaining that each case is distinct with unique motivations. “They want to escape and get something else.”</p><p>“There’s a dissatisfaction,” said Goldenberg in explaining the initial trigger of a conversion. The Christian Tunisians today expressed dissatisfaction with the Islam they knew in Tunisia. While Islamic religious leaders say that it’s due to the converts’ lack of understanding of Islam, the converts offer a different story. Many have done a thorough investigation into their otherwise default religion, and found aspects that they say they disagree with. Or they say that they didn’t find the spiritual satisfaction that they craved for. For some, it was the disappointment, pain and hurt they received from the Islam they knew that motivated them to search elsewhere.</p><p>Some Tunisian Christians identify a spiritual experience such as dreams, visions and encounters, which seemed like a divine intervention to them; they say that the Christian God, or Jesus, revealed himself personally to them. They say these experiences had a significant influence in their motivation to convert.</p><p>It is also important to look at the social context in which the conversions occur. The Jasmine Revolution may be another factor for the influx of young, Muslim Tunisian converting to Christianity. The revolution produced energy for hope and transformation for Tunisians, escaping the decades of dictatorship. It was during this time when many people had hope for positive transformation for their country and lives. Youth turned to joining political and civic groups that fit their personal ideologies. Many youth turned to extremist Islamic groups that gave them a purpose and a rigid ideology to follow. Others felt more freedom to turn to other belief systems, or none at all. “People tend to use what’s around to transform themselves when they want to be transformed,” said Goldenberg.</p><div class="section-media"><div class="section-quote-container"><div class="section-quote"> “According to the U.S. International Religious Freedom Report 2001, the Tunisian 'government does not permit Christian groups to establish new churches and proselytizing is viewed as an act against the public order.' But many churches are emerging in Tunisia since the revolution.”</div></div></div><div class="section-subtitle" title="Churches in Tunisia"><hr/><div class="subtitle-text"> Churches in Tunisia</div></div><p>The official data for the number of churches in Tunisia is almost impossible to obtain. The churches that have registered with the Tunisian government are all aboveground, public places of worship, typically owned and run by foreigners with the permission of the government.</p><p>The Tunisian government recognizes all Christian and Jewish organizations established prior to independence in 1956. The government permits registered Christian churches to operate freely, but the Catholic Church is the only one with formal recognition from the government.</p><p>Tunisia was a protectorate of France during France’s colonization of North Africa in the 19th century. In 1881, France declared Tunisia its protectorate. There is a difference between a protectorate and a colony – a protectorate is under protection of larger country, whereas a colony is under direct rule of that larger country. Under the protectorate, France allowed Tunisia to keep its Islamic courts alongside the French legal system. France also introduced a Franco-Arab education system, introducing French as a second language. During this time, France allowed Catholic missionaries to work in Tunisia. They largely focused on building schools, hospitals, and in doing humanitarian work for the poor and needy, rather than on proselytizing (evangelizing) in order to maintain the support of both Tunisia’s political and religious leaders. When the law of separation of the church and state was passed in France in 1905, there was a divide between the Catholic Church and France, which further reduced the French Catholic outreach in Tunisia.</p><p>Tunisia broke off from France in 1956. And in 1964, Tunisia and the Catholic Church ratified a modus vivendi – an arrangement allowing peaceful coexistence between two otherwise conflicting parties. This was the church-state agreement, and the Catholic Church agreed to avoid public displays of worship and not to proselytize while the Tunisian government formally recognized the exercise of worship of the Catholic Church on its land.</p><p>According to the U.S. International Religious Freedom Report 2001, the Tunisian “government does not permit Christian groups to establish new churches and proselytizing is viewed as an act against the public order.” But many churches are emerging in Tunisia since the revolution.</p><p>Marwan Ben-Said is a convert and an influential Tunisian Christian leader who has networks with local churches across North Africa. As of summer 2015, he estimated that there were 20 to 30 churches in all of Tunisia. Ten of those churches are in the capital, Tunis. Of the 10, five are registered, aboveground churches in accessible, public buildings. The services are run by foreigners for foreigners and are typically Catholic and Anglican. The remaining five churches in the capital are underground – or house-churches – that he knows of. These churches don’t have a distinct location of worship and are largely undetected.</p><p>These house-churches remain non-denominational because of the nature of their recent conception.</p><p>“Me personally, I don’t associate myself with any denomination,” said Dali Khlifi, a Tunisian Christian. He also said that his house-church doesn’t identify with a denomination, but aims to live by the teaching of the Bible.</p><p>“Most of the churches are non-denominational,” said Marwan Ben-Said. “Tunisian leaders, we don’t like to be under any outsider denominations.”</p><p>But house-churches are mostly founded or led by local or foreign Protestant evangelicals. Because the emergence of modern underground churches is a recent phenomenon in Tunisia, divisions of Christianity have yet to solidify and emerge among the Tunisian Christian communities.</p><p>Often, Tunisian Christians are first introduced to aboveground churches before networking and finding other house-church communities.</p><p>But Tunisians who are newly converted find it difficult to walk into a publicly visible church. Although many aboveground churches are open for tourist visits, they fear that the act itself will lead to being caught and exposed.</p><p>“I don't want people to glare at me as I’m walking to church, or give me that awful look when they learn that I’m Christian,” said Manel Marai, a Tunisian Christian.</p><div class="section-subtitle" title="The church that exposed it all: Maya Ibrahim’s story"><hr/><div class="subtitle-text"> The church that exposed it all: Maya Ibrahim’s story</div></div><div class="section-media"><div class="section-image" title="A Muslim girl hesitates on the steps of the church before being led in by her friend.

There is but one lonely, wooden fish etched with the word ‘Jesus’ hanging on a wall.</p><div class="section-media"><div class="section-image" title="A wooden Jesus sign hangs on the walls of this underground church building."> <a href="content/06_UndergroundChurch/Housechurch_Fish.jpg" class="section-image-wrapper" style="background-image:url('content/06_UndergroundChurch/thumbs/Housechurch_Fish.jpg')"> </a></div><div class="section-media-caption"> A wooden Jesus sign hangs on the walls of this underground church building.</div></div><p>“Once I came to Tunisia, God entrusted to me to care for his children that are here,” he said.</p><p>When he heard about the young Tunisian Christian men and women who had left the Catholic and Anglican churches because of disagreements, he was broken hearted. “Division in the church is no good.” After he helped reconcile the young believers with their former pastors, with their warm blessings, he began the Church of Tunis.</p><p>He explained that the young Tunisians coming to his church are craving a deeper intimacy with the community of Tunisian Christian believers. Also, Pastor Andre said that house-churches emphasize spiritual experiences, whereas formal registered churches are more hesitant about that, rather focusing on rites of worship. His church is non-denominational.</p><p>“So we bought some chairs and we continued to pray,” he said tapping the side of his plastic outdoor chair. He chuckled as he pointed to the stack of white chairs at the corner of the room.</p><p>They began worshiping in this very living room. Every week, the young Christians would come to this underground church.</p><p>“We continued to pray in this place until our neighbours began to suspect us.”</p><p>In the beginning, the neighbours had thought Pastor Andre was a French tutor. Later, when they began to play guitar and sing, the neighbours wondered if he was a music teacher.</p><p>But when they noticed more and more young women coming and leaving his apartment, they became suspicious and called the landlord.</p><p>“Knock, knock, knock,” the pastor mimed his encounter. “The landlord was very angry and said ‘I heard you’ve been bringing girls here every weekend.’” This is considered suspicious activity in Tunisia where women and men who aren’t family are forbidden by law from sharing hotel rooms and private locations together.</p><p>The pastor had to invite the landlord in to sit in for their “singing session.”</p><p>The church members were alert. “They had quickly hid their Bibles.”</p><p>After that day, the landlord’s wife and daughter came and interrupted their weekly prayer meetings. They would sit in while the church sang songs.</p><p>“This was not good,” said Pastor Andre. It was dangerous to invite Muslims to their Christian gatherings, in the case that they contact the police and report that a foreigner was evangelizing and converting Muslims.</p><p>It is illegal to proselytize (or evangelize) among Muslims in Tunisia, according to U.S. religious freedom reports; the Tunisian government considers this as “disturbing the public order,” thus unconstitutional. The Catholic Church is the most formally recognized Christian body in Tunisia; however, even the Catholic Church is <a href="http://www.churchinneed.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle%26id=8123%26news_iv_ctrl=1481">prohibited</a> from public displays of religion (such as processions) under the church-state agreement. Under the pre-revolution Ben Ali regime, non-Muslim foreigners suspected of evangelizing were deported and not permitted to return, according to U.S. religious freedoms reports. The new constitution of 2014, while promising freedom of religion, still denounces religious acts that “disturb the public order.”</p><p>However, missionaries are present in Tunisia as well as across North Africa. Many foreign missionaries from churches and organizations around the world enter Tunisia for work, study or tourism. Missionaries are able to work in registered churches. But many missionaries like Pastor Andre form churches and operate underground because the government doesn’t allow building new churches. Missionaries are not permitted to evangelize to Muslims, but many of them still operate away from government watch.</p><p>The neighbours kept complaining and so the church began to pray for solutions.</p><p>A pastor of a church downtown heard about their security problems and offered his building as a place of worship.</p><p>Once underground, today, the small church of 25 five members gather in an aboveground church building in downtown Tunis.</p><p>The plastic chairs in the pastor’s living room were untouched for just over two months, since the Church of Tunis was forced to move locations.</p><div class="section-media"><div class="section-image" title="The plastic chairs used in this underground church."> <a href="content/06_UndergroundChurch/Housechurch_Chairs.jpg" class="section-image-wrapper" style="background-image:url('content/06_UndergroundChurch/thumbs/Housechurch_Chairs.jpg')"> </a></div><div class="section-media-caption"> The plastic chairs used in this underground church.</div></div><p>Pastor Andre said he didn’t know of any other Tunisian house-churches. “We are a bit special because we are the only one,” he said about his Tunisian Christian church.</p><p>But there are many others like his church in Tunisia, from the capital to the Southern cities of Tunisia like Gafsa and Sfax.</p></div></div>
