She had just finished watching <em>A Walk to Remember</em> on TV. This was an American love-story between an irreligious and rebellious teenage boy and a dying, Christian girl. The scene when the boy recited the love poem was her favourite. The little girl had memorized the lines:</p><div class="align-center italics">Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous.</div><div class="align-center italics">Love is never boastful nor conceited.</div><div class="align-center italics">It is never rude or selfish.</div><div class="align-center italics">It does not take offense and it is not resentful.</div><p>“It’s okay to love him, <em>ya binti.</em> But you should love our prophet more,” answered her mother.</p><p>More than a decade later, the same little girl called her mother on the phone.</p><p>“Mom, I go to church on Saturdays,” she said. She didn’t want to lie any longer. Since last year, her family had become suspicious of her travels to Tunis from Kairouan every weekend. It was a four-hour trip back and forth by bus. She was sick of hiding.</p><p>She had tried to seek the God of Islam. She prayed at the mosque almost everyday, every night. She wore the hijab for six years, even before the revolution which meant going against the state for God. She did everything they taught her to do.</p><p>Through the earpiece, came sobbing, weeping, then yelling.</p><p>“I never want to see you again,” cried her mother.</p><p>So the girl was disowned.</p><hr/><div class="section-media"><div class="section-quote-container"><div class="section-quote"> "If you can manage to keep it a secret, you can go on just fine. But I am someone who likes to speak her mind. I don’t like to be secretive. I don’t like to hide. So it’s a bit difficult"</div><div class="section-quote-author"> - Manel</div></div></div><p>It’s been a psychological and mental battle for Manel Marai*, 24, who became a Christian in early 2014. She’s studying in Tunis as an English civilization and literature major. For her, it was a journey from Islam, through what she calls maltheism, to Christianity.</p><p>After searching through many books on Islam and “several angry conversations at night with this ethereal being,” Manel decided to put all religions aside.</p><p>“I was maybe a ‘mal-theist’ – there’s a prefix ‘mal’ in French, basically believing that God is bad,” she said.</p><p>In 2013, she met a friend who she said had an indescribable aura around him. “It was peace. It was magnificent.”</p><p>He turned out to be a Christian which piqued her interest in the Bible. After reading through it, she said it was the representation of the God of love that captivated her. When she decided to become a Christian, Manel said she had luck with her friends whose reactions were surprisingly moderate.</p><p>Some told her that she’s going through a phase. Others would joke around with her.</p><p>“You’re an infidel. You’re going to hell,” they said.</p><p>“I’m fine with those things. They’re comments I get every now and then and I don’t mind,” said Manel. “But what I had with my family, personally that was for me when I was, in a way, persecuted for being Christian.”</p><p>When she told her family six months earlier, she ended up breaking her relationship with her mother. For Tunisian Christians like Manel, revealing their religious identity to family and friends is still a terrifying risk to take in a society where secularism has been implemented for decades. Often, the response they receive can be less than tolerant, what is expected in a democratic society.</p><p>“I cried a lot at first because I had a very good relationship with my mother,” said Manel.</p><p>Her sister, aunts and uncles phoned her after the incident. “Are you trying to kill your mom?” “You made her crazy!” “What’s this nonsense with the Christian thing?”</p><div class="section-media"><div class="section-video"> <video class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls="true" preload="none" poster='content/03_Manel/video/Manel_video1.jpg' data-setup='{ "aspectRatio":"16:9" }'> <source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sunnymock/zeropointthree/content/03_Manel/video/Manel_video1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source> <source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sunnymock/zeropointthree/content/03_Manel/video/Manel_video1.webm" type="video/webm"></source> </video></div><div class="section-media-caption"></div></div><p>Since early 2015, her mother refused to let her go back home. She wasn’t allowed to see her little sister or her grandmother. Whenever someone would ask about her, Manel’s mother refused to have anything to do with her.</p><p>Manel also had a fiancé who decided to leave her. “We had other issues,” she said. But when he asked her to choose between him and Jesus, she drew the line.</p><p>“That’s not a question – it’s Jesus. It’s always going to be Jesus so we broke off our engagement.”</p><p>One of her uncles recently struck a deal with her to come back, on the condition that she said nothing about Christianity. “Bit by bit, they allowed me back in,” said Manel. “But I’m still walking on thin air.”</p><p>She needs to measure every word, calculate every action, she said. “They’re still very dubious of me on Saturdays.”</p><p>Manel is a member of an underground Tunisian-Christian church. They have been worshiping together every Saturday for over a year. Many Tunisian churches gather on Saturdays because Christian foreigners worship on Sundays.</p></div></div>
